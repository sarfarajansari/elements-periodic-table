# Elements Periodic Table

This Django-based application provides complete information about elements from the periodic table. It allows users to search for and view detailed data about each element, including atomic number, symbol, atomic weight, electron configuration, and more.

## Features

- **Element Search**: Users can search for any element by name or symbol to retrieve detailed information.
- **Comprehensive Data**: For each element, the app provides a wealth of data, including:
  - Atomic number
  - Element symbol
  - Atomic weight
  - Electron configuration
  - Boiling point, melting point, density, and more
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate through the periodic table or search for specific elements.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Used for handling the backend logic, data models, and API endpoints.
- **HTML/CSS**: For rendering the frontend interface and displaying element information.
- **SQLite (or other databases)**: Stores element data in a structured format for easy retrieval and management.

## How It Works

1. The app retrieves information from a pre-populated database containing data about the periodic table elements.
2. Users can search for elements by name or symbol.
3. The app displays the requested element's details in a user-friendly format.
4. Users can explore additional data such as atomic properties, uses, and isotopes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarfarajansari/elements-periodic-table.git
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply the migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Conclusion

This application offers a comprehensive and easy-to-use resource for exploring the elements of the periodic table. By providing detailed information about each element, it serves as a useful tool for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning more about chemistry.
